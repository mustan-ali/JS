//Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
//Promise has 2 properties: state and result
//state: initially pending, then either fulfilled when resolve is called or rejected when reject is called
//result: initially undefined, then value if fulfilled or error if rejected
